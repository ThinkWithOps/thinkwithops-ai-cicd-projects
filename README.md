# 🎯 MODULE 1: CI/CD Automation × AI Ops

## Theme → Intelligent Pipelines that Think, Debug, and Communicate  
(10 Projects — Sorted Easy → Medium → Difficult)

This module focuses on building **cost-aware, intelligent CI/CD systems** that integrate DevOps pipelines with AI reasoning — without relying on paid APIs.  
All projects are designed to be **free-tier friendly**, **vendor-neutral**, and **production-minded**.

## 🧠 HOW THIS MODULE BUILDS YOUR AI-DEVOPS PROFILE

| Stage | What You Learn |
|------|----------------|
| Easy | Embed AI reasoning into existing CI/CD workflows for commits, alerts, and summaries |
| Medium | Automate analysis, documentation, and visualization using agents and pipeline metadata |
| Difficult | Design agentic pipelines that diagnose failures, optimize performance, and self-heal |

This progression mirrors **real-world DevOps maturity**, moving from automation → intelligence → autonomy.

## 💸 COST & DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

- No paid AI APIs are required  
- All AI reasoning runs **locally via Ollama**
- Cloud usage stays within **AWS Free Tier**
- Projects are **vendor-agnostic** by design
- Each pipeline is built to be **explainable, auditable, and production-safe**

This approach avoids vendor lock-in while demonstrating real engineering judgment.

## 🎯 WHO THIS MODULE IS FOR

- DevOps Engineers moving into **AI-assisted automation**
- Platform Engineers designing **intelligent pipelines**
- Engineers building a **future-proof portfolio**
- Anyone interested in **AIOps without hype or cost**

## 🚀 HOW TO USE THIS REPOSITORY

Each project lives in its own folder and contains:
- Clear problem statement
- Architecture and workflow explanation
- Step-by-step setup
- Design decisions and trade-offs
- Cleanup and cost-control notes

Projects can be used independently or as a complete learning path.
